# WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Video Demo

This project demonstrates a simple WebRTC peer-to-peer video connection between two clients using a secure WebSocket server for signaling.

## Features

- Peer-to-peer video streaming using WebRTC
- Secure signaling over WebSocket (`wss://`)
- Supports connections between devices on the same network (e.g., between a computer and a phone)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine
- A local network connection for testing on multiple devices (optional)

## Setup

### 1. Generate SSL Certificates

Generate self-signed SSL certificates to enable HTTPS and secure WebSocket (WSS) connections:

    - Place the certificate (`create-cert.pem`) and the private key (`create-cert-key.pem`) in a folder named `certs`.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install express ws
```

### 3. Running the server

```bash
node server.js
```
